# A Year of Code

**A Year of Code** is a project for the next 365 days, starts in 3 march 2017, ending in 3 march 2018.

This is a personal project to keep updating and sharpening my skills by small increments everyday. <br/>
Even if I'm not working on serious coding that day to avoid procrastination.
