# Everyday-Coding

**Everyday Coding** is a project for the next 365 days, starts in 3 march 2017, ending in 3 march 2018.

This is a personal project to keep updating and sharpening my skills by small increments everyday.
Even if I'm not working on serious coding that day to avoid procrastination.
